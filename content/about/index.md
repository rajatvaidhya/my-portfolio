Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Science/Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Jabalpur Engineering College](https://jecjabalpur.ac.in). My interest in coding started back in 2020 during first year of B.tech . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms. Most importantly I'm a [Problem Solver](https://leetcode.com/rajatvaidhya/).

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2024) with [8.06 CGPA]().

Also I've knowledge of Web Development and created some projects on that using HTML, CSS, Javascript / React.js / Node.js, MongoDB and some other cool libraries and frameworks. I'm also a badminton player, represented school and college at state level.

Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.
